# daisychess
A perft-complete (follows all the rules of chess) chess engine in 300 lines of python code, written from scratch in 3 days.

To configure the starting position or which side(s) the engine plays, change the *PLAYERS* and *FEN_START* variables at the bottom of *daisychess.py*. To run, use `python3 daisychess.py`.

TODO:
 - Add more comments!
 - Implement UCI interface
 - Detect stalemates by repetition and 50-move rule
